> assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)

> myMean <- function(assignment2) { return(sum(assignment2)/length(assignment2)) }

> myMean(assignment2)
[1] 19.25

When evaluating the function myMean, we can find the average of the vector used as an input. 
This function uses the sum of the vector using sum(assignment2) and diving it by the total number of elements in the vector using length(assignment2). This will give the mean.
