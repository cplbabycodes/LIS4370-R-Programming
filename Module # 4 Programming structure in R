Here I have histograms of the blood pressure (BP) and the First, Second, 
and Final Decision made by each doctor.

The results explain that the less that a patient frequents the hospital 
might effect if the need for emergency care is low or high. 
There are more results supporting that high need for emergency care is associated with 
bad blood pressure and the boxplot suggests that blood pressure is averaging around 100 
with the highest being twice the average suggesting that there may be more negative 
results over all than positive results and opinions from MD.
